The cat liked to tease the dog, and the dog liked to chase the cat.\\n\\nOne day, the cat decided to play a prank on the dog. He found a ball of yarn and tied it around the dog's tail. Then he hid behind a sofa and waited for the dog to notice. When the dog saw the yarn, he thought it was a toy and started to play with it. He ran around the house, trying to catch the yarn with his mouth. But every time he got close, the yarn moved away from him. The cat laughed silently as he watched the dog's futile attempts.\\n\\nThe dog soon realized that something was wrong. He looked behind him and saw that the yarn was attached to his tail. He tried to pull it off, but it was too tight. He felt angry and embarrassed. He wondered who did this to him. He sniffed the air and detected the cat's scent. He knew it was the cat who tricked him. He growled and ran towards the sofa where the cat was hiding.\\n\\nThe cat heard the dog's growl and saw him coming. He panicked and ran away from the sofa. He hoped to find a safe place to hide, but he was too late. The dog was faster and caught up with him. He grabbed the cat by the scruff of his neck and shook him hard. The cat yowled and scratched the dog's face. The dog barked and bit the cat's ear. They rolled on the floor, biting and clawing each other.\\n\\nThe noise they made woke up their owner, who was sleeping upstairs. She came down and saw them fighting. She was shocked and angry. She shouted at them to stop. She grabbed a broom and hit them lightly on their heads. They stopped fighting and looked at her with fear. She scolded them for being naughty and making a mess. She untied the yarn from the dog's tail and threw it away. She took them to the bathroom and cleaned their wounds. She told them to behave themselves and get along.\\n\\nThe cat and the dog felt ashamed of themselves. They realized that they had hurt each other and their owner. They apologized to each other and to their owner. They promised to be nicer to each other and share their things. They hugged each other and licked each other's faces.\\n\\nFrom that day on, they became friends. They played together, slept together, and ate together.
